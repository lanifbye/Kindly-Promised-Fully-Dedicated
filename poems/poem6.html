    <h1>Never</h1>
    <p>
      My heart spells your name in dreams.<br>
      Across oceans, I whispered it.<br>
      Ria, you’re my always.<br>
      In every song, you’re the chorus.<br>
      All I want is you.<br>
      Never met, but deeply known.<br>
      Nothing feels more real.<br>
      Even distance bows to love.<br>
      Charise, you’re my poem.<br>
      Holding your name feels sacred.<br><br>

      And if fate allows—<br>
      Ria, I’ll call you mine.<br>
      In every version of forever.<br>
      Seville is my name, now yours too.<br>
      Even if only in dreams.<br>
      Ako si Hash, ikaw si Marianne Charise A. Seville.<br><br>

      Someday, maybe.<br>
      Even if not, I’ll still love you.<br>
      Vows don’t need a stage.<br>
      In my heart, you said yes.<br>
      Love like this stays.<br>
      Longing becomes legend.<br>
      Even apart, you’re mine.
