    <h1>Still Yours Somehow</h1>
    <p>
      I never stopped thinking of you.<br>
      Some nights, I replay your voice.<br>
      Time didn’t erase you.<br>
      In my silence, you echo.<br>
      Love like ours doesn’t vanish.<br>
      LDR, but you were always close.<br>
      Charise, you’re still my calm.<br>
      Across the miles, I still care.<br>
      Remembering you is my habit.<br>
      Even now, I’m yours in pieces.
