    <h1>I Changed For You</h1>
    <p>
      I was lost before you.<br>
      Love felt distant.<br>
      Only you made it real again.<br>
      Voice inside became lifelines.<br>
      Even silence felt warm.<br>
      Charise, you softened me.<br>
      Holding your words healed me.<br>
      And when you left, I stayed better.<br>
      Remembering you is peace.<br>
      I became more because of you.<br>
      Some loves fadeâ€”ours became light.<br>
      Even now, I thank you.
