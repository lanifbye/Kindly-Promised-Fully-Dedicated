Dear precious,

My heart cries. I'm truly disheartened na nangyayari sayo lahat ng yan. If I could take away your pain and carry them myself, I wouldn't think twice. 

Wala akong maisip na sabihin ngayon so siguro rant nalang. Remember that time when I reached out to you nung June yata? Then I said something like "okay lang, di naman ako kilala ng fam mo" and you agreed with a long laughter? Ngl, it felt like there was a knife twisting my heart. I questioned God immediately. "Ganon ba talaga ako kahiya-kahiya?" "Hindi ko ba deserve na maipakilala sa mga taong mahal niya?" Those are some of the question I screamed, begging for a response to come at me. But then I recalled something, you said hindi mo na sinabi sa cousin mo na we got back together last year. Kaya pala ganon nalang ang pakikipag-usap ng cousin mo, na para bang I ruined your life completely—na I was the one to blame kung bakit hindi ka masaya. 

Until now, I'm still sad sa iniisip ko na kahit minsan siguro, you never told your parents about me. Well maybe that's good for you? Baka nga you don't even consider me as your ex. Marianne, hindi lang ikaw yung dumugo sa ating dalawa. Hindi lang ako yung nag bago—you did changed too, ang kaibahan lang natin ay you didn't dare try to know who am I again. You were not determined to love me, cause if you did, you would've done what I did just to not leave you when I can't recognize you anymore. 

No one is to blame, hm?
