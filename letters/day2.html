    <h1>Day 2</h1>
    <p>08/22/24

Dear baby,

Day 2 of writing for you everyday until your 19th birthday. I've finally accepted na hindi lahat ng goodbye ay masama. I'm starting to forgive myself na, baby. I’ve stopped dwelling on the past. I'm slowly accepting the fact that the past should stay where it is. Honestly speaking, it was unfair for me cause one of the reason you broke up with me is that you couldn't recognize me anymore. I felt that too, but I said to myself that if you were to change even though hindi na kita kilala ay kikilalanin kita. That's where I realized that to love someone is to be determined and that to enter a relationship is to commit. Baby, I'm really grateful that you pushed me away. We didn't deserve each other. You needed more attention, love, affection, and care—and I needed to be understood more. Please don't think of this message as if I'm blaming you, I'm just pouring my last words for you. 

I questioned myself a lot when you reposted about you being excited to be a girlfriend cause the last time, you were the boyfriend. You should've told me, I thought that it was okay to you na I acted that way. I guess I was too childish. Baby, I'm here to admit all of my mistakes and pagkukulang. I thought it was cringe for me na suyuin ka, sa akin, baka isipin mong ang corny ko and isip bata. I really did my best to do what you wanted tho, but doing it on a gadget isn't just my thing. 

Hindi ko na iniisip ko kasalanan ko lahat kung bakit tayo nag tapos. I know to myself and the Lord knows too na dumugo ako just to reach what you wanted. But talagang magkaiba tayo. Opposite sides yung daan natin. I wasn't the only one who were immature, I hope you realized that, baby. We were each other's stepping stone, I guess?

Baby, hindi lahat ng ineexpect niyo sa isang guy ay ganon na. Yung mga guy na nasa wattpad, tiktok, etc., they are all fictions for a reason. Girls must accept na walang perfect na guy—and vice versa. I encourage you to seek God first, above all else. Before ka po mag asam ng isang bagay, you should reflect if deserve mo ba yun. That's what I did kaya nakaalis na ako sa lugar kung saan "tayo". I’ve reflected and realized that I didn’t deserve you. And maybe, you didn’t deserve me either. You were too soft for me, and I was too advanced for you. You focused on fulfilling what you missed and what you didn't have. I focused on fulfilling on what's coming. Hindi tayo nagtugma. And you're right, magkaiba kasi tayo ng priorities. I prioritized to build something for myself and us in the future beside you, you prioritezed to enjoy the moment and live with it. Baby, realism kasi ako. 

I also advice you to be mentally stable first before entering a relationship. Aminin natin na sobrang nahirapan tayo kasi parehas tayong ganon. But now I'm growing. Love yourself before anyone else. Hindi ka makakapagmahal ngg ibang tao hangga't hindi mo mahal ang sarili mo. Baby, STOP SEEKING LOVE FROM OTHER PEOPLE kasi nasasayo yung hinahanap mo, nakay Lord.

See you tomorrow!

Your past,
Hash
