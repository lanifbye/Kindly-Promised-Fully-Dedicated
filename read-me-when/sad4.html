    <h1>Read Me When You're Sad</h1>
    <p>
      I know things feel heavy right now. I made this message for moments like this—
      when the world feels too much and you need a reminder that you're not alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a deep breath. Let yourself feel everything. You don’t have to rush through it.
      I’m here, even if just through words on a screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are loved. You are strong. And this sadness will pass, even if it doesn’t feel like it yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever you're ready, you can move to the next message or return to the mood list.
