    <h1>Read Me When You're Happy</h1>
    <p>
      Every bit of happiness you're experiencing right now is something you deserve.<br>
      Keep whatever brought you joy close at hand.<br>
      Enjoy it to the fullest, guilt-free and without hesitation.<br>
      After much waiting and hard labor, it is now yours.<br>
      Breathe in this moment instead of hurrying through it.<br>
      Even if no one else is there, let your heart sing.<br>
      Not only did you deserve this today, but you also deserved it for all the silent struggles you kept to yourself.<br>
      Even if the joy wanes, keep in mind how it felt. I hope it lasts.<br>
      You are free to be soft, proud, and independent.<br>
      When you're smiling, the world is a better place.<br>
      So go ahead and enjoy yourself without looking back.
